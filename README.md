# Decntralized Chatting Application using Tokenized Incentives

The decentralized chat application aims to offer an immutable, privacyfocused, and highly resilient alternative to traditional messaging platforms, ensuring uninterrupted and tamper-proof communication. Also the amount of time or transactions the users carry out on the application will be rewarded by giving them crypto tokens which will be listed later and users will be able to trade them at market price at that time.
